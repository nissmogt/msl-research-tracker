# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RAILWAY SECURITY ISSUE

## Problem
- EdgeAuthMiddleware is NOT blocking direct Railway access
- Rate limiting is NOT working
- Direct Railway access returns full data instead of 403 Forbidden

## Root Cause
The `EDGE_SECRET` environment variable is likely **NOT SET** on Railway.

## Immediate Fix Required

### 1. Set EDGE_SECRET on Railway
```bash
# In Railway dashboard or CLI:
railway variables set EDGE_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Check that both are set:
- `EDGE_SECRET` (for authentication) 
- `BACKEND_BASE` (should not be needed on Railway but verify)

### 3. Expected Behavior After Fix
- Direct Railway access should return: `{"detail":"Forbidden: Direct access not allowed"}`
- Rate limiting should block after 10 requests per minute
- Only Vercel proxy with correct X-Edge-Auth header should work

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Should return 403 Forbidden
curl https://msl-research-tracker-production.up.railway.app/articles/recent

# Should work (via Vercel proxy)

```

## Security Impact
**HIGH RISK**: Backend is currently exposed to public internet without authentication!
